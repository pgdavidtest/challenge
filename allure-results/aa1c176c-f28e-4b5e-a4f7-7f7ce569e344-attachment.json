"Traded in a 64GB XR for this pink iPhone 13 128GB. The min storage of 128 GB is the bare adequate minimum for Apple, and it works well in combination with iCloud subscription (what is Apple's intent no doubt :) ). The screen is finally nice, the photo app, filters and sensors are top notch - what is exactly the most used functionality in a phone. Size and shape are very useful, in a trendy TPU plastic the edges don't feel sharp, and the phone remains secured in the case. Battery seems to last a while. This was a purchase for a teenage girl, and it seems a well suited product for that purpose - great cameras, camera app, light body, durable, good screen and lasting battery, 128GB standard storage (even with iCloud backup photos and videos take immediate space until they get synchronized). Apps data also takes a lot of space. Normal daily girls' install takes around 30-35GB storage, you need 10-ish more for major OS updates, so ANY Apple product with 64GB is practically obsolete even with cloud services.\nShe doesn't miss the telephoto, teenage girls are not into that type of photography. However, the new photo styles are on the spot right. I myself have a Pro :), but that is too heavy"
