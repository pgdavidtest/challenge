"What else can I say but awesome!  Well worth the money and a special thanks to the delivery guys Jared and Philip. They actually came early, called first and helped unbox it. Then Jared gave me his number if I had any questions. Well they offered to take the box which was huge too. Turned out they accidentally took the base and remote. Jared brought them to me the next morning before I even new they were missing. Also tv comes with Samsung TV + for free. Has TV and free movies."
