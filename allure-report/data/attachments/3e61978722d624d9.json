"At first I was on the fence with this watch. A lot of people said they never used theirs and it just sat on their dresser. For the amount of money this thing is I didn’t want to at least try it out. After using it for exercise and following its directions to get up and move, I realized how useful it can be. Not to mention when I don’t have time to pick up my phone, I can answer calls, check notifications and more all while holding my newborn. It’s great! You really have to be someone who needs it and will use it for the features it has rather than wanting to look cool with one."
