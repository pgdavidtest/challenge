customers Reviews: What else can I say but awesome!  Well worth the money and a special thanks to the delivery guys Jared and Philip. They actually came early, called first and helped unbox it. Then Jared gave me his number if I had any questions. Well they offered to take the box which was huge too. Turned out they accidentally took the base and remote. Jared brought them to me the next morning before I even new they were missing. Also tv comes with Samsung TV + for free. Has TV and free movies.
customers Reviews: I love this TV. Crystal clear picture. Looks great mounted on the wall.
customers Reviews: Nice picture quality and it sounds really nice especially with the sound bar.

customers Reviews: I always went for the pros or the max phones but this time around I wanted to get something handy and decent. Love the size of this phone and performance is on par with what I expected. Coming from the 12 pro max, I do miss the 3rd camera but the picture quality in general is way better now. Photographic styles are amazing
customers Reviews: Traded in a 64GB XR for this pink iPhone 13 128GB. The min storage of 128 GB is the bare adequate minimum for Apple, and it works well in combination with iCloud subscription (what is Apple's intent no doubt :) ). The screen is finally nice, the photo app, filters and sensors are top notch - what is exactly the most used functionality in a phone. Size and shape are very useful, in a trendy TPU plastic the edges don't feel sharp, and the phone remains secured in the case. Battery seems to last a while. This was a purchase for a teenage girl, and it seems a well suited product for that purpose - great cameras, camera app, light body, durable, good screen and lasting battery, 128GB standard storage (even with iCloud backup photos and videos take immediate space until they get synchronized). Apps data also takes a lot of space. Normal daily girls' install takes around 30-35GB storage, you need 10-ish more for major OS updates, so ANY Apple product with 64GB is practically obsolete even with cloud services.
She doesn't miss the telephoto, teenage girls are not into that type of photography. However, the new photo styles are on the spot right. I myself have a Pro :), but that is too heavy
customers Reviews: Overall I am happy with my iPhone 13. I came from the an iPhone 7 so this was a major upgrade. The screen i larger than what I'm used to, face is quicker than touch ID if I'm not wearing a mask, my photos are better, battery lasts substantially longer, the phone is noticeably quicker, and I get 5G speeds when I'm not on wifi. The associate was extremely helpful and helped me activate my new phone/restore all my info from my backup.


My only complaint is that many of my apps keep crashing whenever I use them for some strange reason. This happens so much more often on my new phone than my old iPhone 7. I couldnt figure out why this was happening and even restarted my phone multiple times. The hardware is better so I think it was an issue with iOS itself. I ended up wiping my phone and redownloading everything manually instead of using a backup. This solved the issue and I haven't had apps randomly close/crash on me again.
