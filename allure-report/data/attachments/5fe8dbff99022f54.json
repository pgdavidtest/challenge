"Overall I am happy with my iPhone 13. I came from the an iPhone 7 so this was a major upgrade. The screen i larger than what I'm used to, face is quicker than touch ID if I'm not wearing a mask, my photos are better, battery lasts substantially longer, the phone is noticeably quicker, and I get 5G speeds when I'm not on wifi. The associate was extremely helpful and helped me activate my new phone/restore all my info from my backup.\n\n\nMy only complaint is that many of my apps keep crashing whenever I use them for some strange reason. This happens so much more often on my new phone than my old iPhone 7. I couldnt figure out why this was happening and even restarted my phone multiple times. The hardware is better so I think it was an issue with iOS itself. I ended up wiping my phone and redownloading everything manually instead of using a backup. This solved the issue and I haven't had apps randomly close/crash on me again."
