# Mini-Project
3.	AUTOMATION TESTING
3.1	SCOPE
Automated Test Scripts are created for the above 5 functional manual testing. The automation was done using WebDriverIO and Cucumber Framework (DLR6)
3.2	TEST APPROACH
To achieve the test automation, WebDriverIO tool was used as required with Cucumber framework. I used Page Object Model design pattern. 
3.3	AUTOMATION REQUIREMENT
Listed below in bullet form are the automation requirement base on the challenge. I have also listed these requirements in a CHECK LIST with status to show if each requirement was achieved or not. 
•	All test inputs were data driven for easy maintenance and reusability.
•	Test execution can be triggered from Jenkins. 
•	Automation run report generated. 
•	Log to Console and Report number Item returned and top 3 reviews.
•	Report should clearly generate relevant metrics that shows the effectiveness of automation.
•	Capturing execution time per test and Screenshot to view failed TC.
•	Report should include the preceding n runs where n 3.
•	All Delivery should be done via Github, to include Readme, (Video capture) and test report.
•	Test should be architected such that they can be executed iteratively multiple times with different set of test imputes.
•	One of the 5 testcases should run with 3 different test set.
•	Use design pattern so that test can be run independently.
•	Use standard practice.
