# Mini-Project
3.	AUTOMATION TESTING
3.1	SCOPE
Automated Test Scripts are created for the above 5 functional manual testing. The automation was done using WebDriverIO and Cucumber Framework (DLR6)
3.2	TEST APPROACH
To achieve the test automation, WebDriver IO tool was used as required with Cucumber framework. I used Page Object Model design pattern. 
3.3	AUTOMATION REQUIREMENT
Listed below in bullet form are the automation requirement base on the challenge. I have also listed these requirements in a CHECK LIST with status to show if each requirement was achieved or not. 
•	All test inputs were data driven for easy maintenance and reusability (DLR7).
•	Test execution can be triggered from Jenkins (DLR8) 
•	Automation run report generated (DLR9) 
•	Log to Console and Report number Item returned and top 3 reviews (DLR10)
•	Report should clearly generate relevant metrics that shows the effectiveness of automation. (DLR11)
•	Capturing execution time per test and Screenshot to view failed TC (DLR12)
•	Report should include the preceding n runs where n 3. (DLR13)
•	All Delivery should be done via Github, to include Readme, (Video capture) and test report (DLR14)
•	Test should be architected such that they can be executed iteratively multiple times with different set of test imputes (DLR115)
•	One of the 5 testcases should run with 3 different test set (DLR16)
•	Use design pattern so that test can be run independently (DLR17)
•	Use standard practice (DLR18)
